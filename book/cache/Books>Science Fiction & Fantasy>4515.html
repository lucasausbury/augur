The underlying theme that love will win out regardless of prohibition is a powerful idea that will speak to teens.&#8221; (School Library Journal)&#8220;The gasp-worthy final page sets the stage for a promising conclusion to this trilogy.&#8221; (Bulletin of the Center for Children&#8217;s Books)Praise for Delirium:&#8220;In [Oliver&#8217;s] dystopian America, love has been outlawed as the life-threatening source of all discord.

With a pulse-pounding tempo and unforeseen twists and turns, Lauren Oliver has opened the door on a fantastic new series; the second book can&#8217;t come soon enough.&#8221; (New York Journal of Books)Praise for Delirium:&#8220;In a thick climate of fear, Oliver spins out a suspenseful story of awakening and resistance with true love at its core.&#8221; (The Horn Book)Praise for Before I Fall:&#8220;Oliver&#8217;s debut novel is raw, emotional, and, at times, beautiful....readers will love Samantha best as she hurtles toward an end as brave as it is heartbreaking.&#8221; (Publishers Weekly (starred review))Praise for Before I Fall:&#8220;Samantha&#8217;s attempts to save her life and right the wrongs she has caused are precisely what will draw readers into this complex story and keep them turning pages until Sam succeeds in living her last day the right way.&#8221; (Voice of Youth Advocates (VOYA) (Starred Review))Praise for Before I Fall:&#8220;Oliver, in a pitch-perfect teen voice, explores the power we have to affect the people around us in this intensely believable first novel...This is a compelling book with a powerful message and should not be missed.&#8221; (ALA Booklist)Praise for Before I Fall:&#8220;This story races forward, twisting in a new direction every few pages, its characters spinning my emotions from affection to frustration, anger to compassion. You&#8217;ll have no choice but to tear through this book!&#8221; (Jay Asher, author of the New York Times bestseller Thirteen Reasons Why)Praise for Before I Fall:&#8220;Before I Fall is smart, complex, and heartbreakingly beautiful.
